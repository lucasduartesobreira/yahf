# Yet Another HTTP Framework

> **Warning: Currently in the experimental phase, everything can change.**

The goal of `YAHF` is both to provide a good developer experience and to be easy to extend. 

Following the author's vision, those are the project rules:
It runs on stable rust;
Serialization and Deserialization internally dealt with;
No new macros;

## Goals for v1.0.0

> **`YAHF` follows the `SemVer`.**

The objective for v1.0.0 is to have a stable project that can deal with real-world problems with good developer experience and the possibility to extend the project to suit any need.

The goals for this version are:

- [ ] Composable routing system;
- [ ] Middleware functions;
- [ ] HTTP/1.1 with or without security.
